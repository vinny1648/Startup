## Startup Specification

- Pitch
  - Dungeons and Dragons along with many other role-playing games have highly specific character building methods that easily confuse the players. Using the Character Creator, players can make all of the easy decisions while all of the stats are automatically calculated. The other Problem with the game is finding friends to play who are closeby and have time. The game finder function will connect players to chat rooms where they can play the game with random players or with players of their choosing.
 
- Technologies Used
  - HTML: Correct use of several web pages including one for a character builder, chat room, login, etc.
  - CSS: Proper design and visual appeal as well as being easy to navigate
  - JAVASCRIPT: Calculates player scores and stats and manages login
  - REACT: Changins web page depending on character creation options that would be determined by previous options chosen
  - SERVICE: several backend services including:
    - calculating statistics for characters
    - randomized dice rolls
    - sending and receiving characters
    - randomizing characters
  - DB/LOGIN: Saving character sheets and logging game interactions
  - WEBSOCKET: live chats for players in-game with live dice rolling
