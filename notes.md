# Notes for C S 260

## First notes about github and git
Merging conflicts takes a fat minute to figure out so dont forget these steps
- add the new content (little plus sign)
- Commit changes, dont forget to put a message or everything crashes
- merge the conflict. i guess it really isnt that much, but it took me a while
